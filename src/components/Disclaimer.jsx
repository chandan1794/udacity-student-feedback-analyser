			<h1>Welcome Mentors üòä</h1>

				This is a simple tool to view the feedback in a beautiful UI which we
				receive from the students whose projects we review at Udacity.
			</p>

			<br />

			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p>
				For the past couple of months, the feedback section on the mentor
				dashboard has been disabled because of which we can't directly see the
				feedback given by our students. Some of us have been using{" "}
				<a
					href="https://review-api.udacity.com/api/v1/me/student_feedbacks"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer noopener"
				>
					this API
				</a>{" "}
				to get the feedback data in JSON format to know what feedback we have
				received from the students.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also use this trick for the same. It was difficult to quickly find the
				ratings and students' comments in the JSON data obtained from this API.
				I thought why not create a simple tool to convert this JSON into a
				beautiful UI? So, I got a cup of coffee and tapped few keys on the
				keyboard to create this simple tool that can show your feedback data in
				a good and easy to visualize UI. Here is how it looks with some sample
				JSON data:
